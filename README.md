### 👋 Hello there! I'm Marcos Pontes

💻 I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development, and diving deep into the world of Front-End development.

🎯 Focused on learning the core web technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

🧠 Always curious and eager to grow. I enjoy studying, building small projects, and improving one step at a time.

🕹️ In my free time, you’ll find me playing **World of Warcraft** (For the Horde! 🐺), having good conversations with friends, or enjoying a good laugh.
